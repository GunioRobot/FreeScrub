FreeScrub 0.1
A FOSS metadata scrubber supporting PNG, PDF, TIFF, and JPEG files (with more to come).
By Michael McKinley (mikm), Chris Tandiono (christandiono) and Rich Jones (Miserlou)

FreeScrub is a PyGTK based application which will scrub EXIF and other metadata out of images
and documents. This is useful for people who want to publish images and documents without
revealing any information about their location, their camera or their computer hardware. It's also
quite useful for web developers as it reduces the size of the file by removing unneccesary text
strings embedded inside files.

FreeScrub was conceived as an idea in a reddit thread [1] and born on GitHub [2].

Currently, it works very well for JPEG, TIFF and PNG images. It will also remove the simplest metadata
from PDF documents, however it won't yet scrub the metadata from the images inside the PDF.
